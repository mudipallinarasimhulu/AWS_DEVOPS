#kubernetes 
* when your trying to create pods by default  two container will create .
* first it will create pause container then it will create actual container
* pause container will first create namespace and then it will assign to container and assign the ip address 
* container inside pods will share the all the resource in the pods
* using deploymnet pods will re-create if the pods are down 
* you can run two different containers in single pods 
* to reduce tlatencry problem will create two differenet contianers in single in pods ( multi  container) 
* 

* services will create on top of the deploymnet 
1.cluster ip
2.nodeport
3.load balancer

* we will use cluster ip to bind the pods and in different nodes 
* how communications happen inside the nodes 
* pods1 (applications)  >> node1 >> node2 >> pods2 (BD server)
* service ( cluster ip ) will take care of the binding the pods ip to the service internally ( if re-start or re-installed the pods )
